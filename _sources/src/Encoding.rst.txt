====================
Charset and Encoding
====================

Basically:

    #.  charset is the set of characters you can use
    #.  encoding is the way these characters are stored into memory

Every encoding has a particular charset associated with it, but there can be 
more than one encoding for a given charset. A charset is simply what it sounds 
like, a set of characters. There are a large number of charsets, including many 
that are intended for particular scripts or languages.

However, we are well along the way in the transition to Unicode, which includes 
a character set capable of representing almost all the world's scripts. However,
there are multiple encodings for Unicode. An encoding is a way of mapping a 
string of characters to a string of bytes. Examples of Unicode encodings include
UTF-8 [#b]_ , UTF-16 BE [#c]_ , and UTF-16 LE [#c]_ . Each of these 
has advantages for particular applications or machine architectures.


A character encoding consists of:

    -   The set of supported characters
    -   A mapping between characters and integers ("code points")
    -   How code points are encoded as a series of "code units" (e.g., 16-bit units for UTF-16)
    -   How code units are encoded into bytes (e.g., big-endian or little-endian)
    
    
Unicode:

-   CJK = Chinese-Japanese-Korean
